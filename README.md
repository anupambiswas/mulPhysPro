Multi-physics simulation software development using C++

This is a multi-physics numerical simulation project. This mainly deals with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Heat Transfer. The software development is implemented in C++.

This project is ongoing and hence many more changes will soon be committed. More details about the software application will be added.
