Multi-physics simulation software development using C++

This is a multi-physics numerical simulation project. This mainly deals with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Heat Transfer. The software development is implemented in C++.

This project is ongoing and hence many more changes will soon be committed. More details about the software application will be added.

Two projects are added at present. The case files are provided in 'cases' directory. The projects are in sub-directories 'case_0' and 'case_1'. README.txt files are provided for both projects which give description and running guidelines. In case of a difficulty, feel free to contact anupambiswas85@gmail.com.
